Hello!

My name is Keyle Barnes! I am currently a Computer Science student with a focus in UX and UI design! I use They/Them/Theirs. This site was created as part of Out in Tech Intership Program [My CV](/cv).

Currently I am studiing at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, for a Computer Science Major and a minor in UI/UX Experience. I have a unique skill set as my background is Cybersecurity, some Digital Design, Customer Service, and a focus in Acessibility. 

I am 19 and some of my interests include Photography, Playing the Guitar, Digital Art, Film, and loving cats! 

## Ideals
When working one of my goals is to directly help people. Solving people's issues and helping them with their issues is what makes me feel fafilled in life. This fuels my passion for work every single day. This also leads into how important creating accessible spaces for everyone is important to me. I am disabled and often this creates barriers for me in my life, which is frustrating. I seek to help destory those barriers as much as possible both on the web and in person, as everyone deserves to have a voice.
