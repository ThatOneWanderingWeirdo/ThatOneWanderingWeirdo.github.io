# Tobias Barnes's Personal site
This site was created as apart of Out in Tech's Mentorship Program in 2022 [Read more here](https://outintech.com/mentorship-program/)
The goal was to create a personal site for myself to learn and practice creating a website with a framework, as well as design

One added feature of this site was learning how to create multiple pages and display them in the navigation bar

This uses jekyll as a base and the TeXt theme
