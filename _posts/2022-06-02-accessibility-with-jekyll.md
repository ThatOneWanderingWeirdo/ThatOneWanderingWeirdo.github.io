## Intro

So now that I have created the bare bones of this site, I realized I needed to look further into why I created this site in the first place. I wanted to learn how to create sites with more acessibility built in mind as the web is too often lacking. 

## Checking the Site

So following the advice of http://www.goring.org/resources/accessibility.html I ran my site through https://achecker.achecks.ca to look at where my site needs fixing to help. This was very insightful as many lines of code were needing adjustment and I can now focus better on that. What is great is AChecker helps you to not only see what is wrong, but why that would be an issue. I personally don't use a screen reader so I don't always see all of the flaws that do happen from poor design.I will hopefully go through soon and adjust all of what is need to help, as well as continue learning
